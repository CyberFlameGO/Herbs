# Herbs
Minecraft plugin for a server Iâ€™m working on. I used Eclipse for this. Compile using `mvn install`. 
[PlayerListener.java](https://github.com/CyberFlameGO/Herbs/blob/master/src/main/java/me/cyberflame/herbs/PlayerListener.java) is where the plugin does its magic, and it sets a poppy to air on right-click, gives you the poppy, and replaces the poppy after 5 minutes. It also runs a say command for testing purposes.
